# light-sensor-
this is light sensor for my dorm. 

I have a Govee Lightbulb. They can be controlled via HTTP request.
I have an esp32 along with a motion detector. 
perfect match. 

When my esp32 detects some motion. (not my bank account), it sends an HTTP request. 
Simple as dat.

I have way too much free time. 


# ok but how tho?
